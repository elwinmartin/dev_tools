# dev_tools
Quick access web development scripts. Except for importing an existing rendering engine and running PHP regex, this project should be written in Haskell.

## Encodings
Quickly encoding or unencoding text used for web development.
### JSON en/decode
Need a linking between JSON character names, endoings, and unicode. Need a means to parse JSON object to a dictionary.
### HTML en/decode
Need a linking between HTML character names, endoings, and unicode.
### Encoding detection
Ideally, we want to detect encodings of JSON and HTML and return highlighting or some flag that says if something is singly or doubly encoded.
## Regex (PHP) Test
This is another thing I see available online all the time but I would like an offline version. 

Would be fine with simply converting strings and running PHP locally.

## Rendering
I want to be able to render HTML quickly 
### HTML Rendering Engine
I would be down to write something that renders raw html without CSS.

I am also interested in existing rendering engines for broader features.
### Transformed Text
For text transformations, there should be rendering of the results in the same window as where HTML would be rendered.
